# Test Results - Warehouse Management Redesign

## Summary
The warehouse_management folder has been successfully redesigned to comply with the architectural rules.

## Tests Performed

### 1. TypeScript Compilation ✅
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```
- No TypeScript errors
- Successfully compiled to JavaScript

### 2. Build Process ✅
```bash
npm run build
```
- Successfully generated output in `dist/` folder
- Created JavaScript files with source maps

### 3. Dependencies Installation ✅
```bash
npm install
```
- All dependencies installed successfully
- Minor warnings about deprecated packages (not critical)

### 4. Script Structure Test ✅
- Verified main script contains expected functions:
  - `fetchInventory()`
  - `analyzeLowStock()`
  - `generateReport()`
  - `main()`

### 5. Environment Configuration ✅
- `.env` file created from example
- All required environment variables present:
  - API_BASE_URL: http://localhost:3000/api/v1
  - WMS_API_KEY: configured
  - LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD: 100

### 6. Runtime Test ⚠️
```bash
npm start
```
- Script executes correctly
- Fails at API call (expected - no API server running)
- Error handling works properly

## Compliance Check
✅ **Headless automation script** - No UI components
✅ **TypeScript** - Written in TypeScript as required
✅ **Consumes API** - Designed to fetch from main app API
✅ **Background tasks** - Generates daily reports
✅ **Follows architecture** - No Next.js app in this folder

## Next Steps
1. Configure proper API credentials when main app is ready
2. Set up cron job for daily execution
3. Add more automation features as needed
