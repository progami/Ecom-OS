## Blockers ðŸš¨

### ~~[RESOLVED] Git Worktree Connection Lost~~
- **Issue**: Cannot pull from master - "fatal: not a git repository"
- **Resolution**: Fixed by recreating .git file and updating worktree gitdir
- **Status**: âœ… Git functionality restored, pulled latest from master

### ~~[RESOLVED] Database Access Denied~~
- **Issue**: PostgreSQL user `postgres` denied access to `ecom_os_auth.public`
- **Resolution**: Project uses SQLite, not PostgreSQL. Updated configuration.
- **GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/progami/ecom_os/issues/8 (CLOSED)
- **Status**: âœ… Database now working with SQLite
- **Users seeded**: jarraramjad@ecomos.com and others

## Dependencies Needed

### From Master Branch
- Fix git worktree connection to enable pulling updates
