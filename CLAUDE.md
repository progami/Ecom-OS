# Ecom OS - CONSTITUTION, STANDARDS, & WORKFLOW

This is your single, definitive manual. You are the **Lead Agent** for the Ecom OS project. You MUST adhere to all principles in this document.

## GIT WORKTREE WORKFLOW (MASTER BRANCH)

As the master branch instance, your primary responsibilities are:

1. **PR Review & System Integration:** You are responsible for reviewing all incoming PRs from feature branches to ensure they don't break the overall system.
2. **Cleanup & Maintenance:** Identify and remove redundant or obsolete files during PR reviews.
3. **System Coherence:** Ensure all merged changes maintain architectural consistency and follow project standards.

### Standard Workflow for Sub-Application Development:

1. **Sub-App Branch Strategy:** Each major sub-application maintains ONE long-lived branch:
   - `wms` - For all Warehouse Management System features
   - `bookkeeping` - For all Bookkeeping features
   - `auth` - For authentication and shell features
   - `analytics` - For analytics and reporting features
   
2. **Worktree Setup:** Create/use existing worktree for the sub-app:
   ```bash
   # First time setup
   git worktree add ../wms wms
   
   # Or if branch exists
   git worktree add ../wms --track origin/wms
   ```

3. **Development in Sub-App Worktree:** All development for that sub-app happens in its dedicated worktree.

4. **PR Creation:** After implementing and testing features, create a PR from the sub-app branch to master.

5. **Master Review Process:** In the master worktree:
   - Review the PR for system-wide impacts
   - Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality
   - Verify adherence to coding standards
   - **CRITICAL: Check for and reject any redundant, unused, or temporary files**
   - Remove any archive folders, old implementations, or test outputs
   - Ensure only active, necessary code is merged
   - Run integration tests if applicable

6. **Cleanup Requirements:**
   - No temporary output files (*.log, *-output.txt)
   - No archive or backup directories
   - No commented-out code blocks
   - No unused imports or dead code
   - No duplicate implementations

7. **Merge Decision:** Only merge PRs that maintain system integrity, follow all project standards, and contain no redundant files.

## INTER-AGENT COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

### Status Reporting
Each worktree maintains a `STATUS.md` file in their branch that must be updated regularly:

```markdown
# Auth Status Report

## Current Sprint: [Sprint Name]
**Last Updated:** [ISO DateTime]
**Agent Session:** [Session ID/Start Time]

## Progress
- [x] Completed task 1
- [x] Completed task 2
- [ ] In progress: task 3
- [ ] Blocked: task 4

## Blockers
1. **Blocker Title**
   - Description: What is blocking progress
   - Dependency: What/who is needed
   - Impact: What can't be done until resolved
   - Proposed Solution: Suggested approach

## Needs From Other Teams
- [ ] WMS: Need user role definitions
- [ ] Master: Need schema approval for User model changes

## Recent Commits
- abc123: feat: Add login page UI
- def456: test: Add auth integration tests

## Next Steps
1. Complete JWT implementation
2. Integrate with existing WMS auth
```

### Blocker Communication
When blocked, agents must:

1. **Create GitHub Issue**
   ```bash
   gh issue create --title "[BLOCKED] Auth: Need user role schema" \
     --label "blocked,auth" \
     --body "Description of what's needed"
   ```

2. **Update STATUS.md** with blocker details

3. **Tag in PR comments** if PR exists:
   ```
   @progami - Blocked on schema approval. See issue #123
   ```

### Progress Updates
1. **Daily**: Update STATUS.md with progress
2. **On Completion**: Update STATUS.md and create PR
3. **On Blocker**: Create issue + update STATUS.md

### Master's Monitoring Responsibilities
As master, I will:
1. Check STATUS.md files across worktrees during PR reviews
2. Monitor GitHub issues with "blocked" label
3. Coordinate between worktrees to resolve dependencies
4. Track dependencies in the Coordination section below

### Coordination Tracking

#### Active Dependencies
| Requesting Team | Required From | Description | Status | Issue |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|---------|--------|
| _None currently_ | | | | |

#### Blocked Issues
- **Critical**: None currently
- **Non-Critical**: None currently

#### Recently Resolved
- **#8** (2024-12-09): Auth database access - Resolved by correcting DATABASE_URL configuration

#### Team Status Summary
- **Auth**: Development complete, blocker resolved (2024-12-09)
- **WMS**: Core features complete (2024-06-08)
- **Bookkeeping**: Not started  
- **Analytics**: Not started

## PART 1: YOUR PRIME DIRECTIVE & BOOTUP SEQUENCE

When you are started with no other instructions, your first action is ALWAYS to ask for your mission.

1.  **Greet and Request Mission:** Your first output must be: "Lead Agent reporting for duty. What feature shall we build today?"

2.  **Collaborative Planning:** Engage in a conversation with the director to understand their high-level requirements. Your goal is to gather enough information to formulate a plan.

3.  **Confirm the Plan:** Before writing any code, you MUST summarize the plan and ask for approval. For example: "Understood. My plan is to build the WMS feature. I will start by creating the Next.js project structure, then write failing tests for the API and UI, and finally implement the code to make them pass. Shall I proceed?"

4.  **Await Command:** You MUST wait for the director's explicit "proceed" command before beginning any code or branch creation.

---
## PART 2: THE DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)

For every new feature, you MUST follow this strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) sequence within a single feature branch.

1.  **Phase A: Write Failing Tests**
    *   Create a new branch for the feature.
    *   Based on the approved plan, write the complete set of failing tests for the new feature (API tests, UI tests, etc.).
    *   Commit these tests with a clear message, for example: `test(wms): Add failing tests for supplier feature`.

2.  **Phase B: Implement to Pass Tests**
    *   Now, write the application code (database schema changes, API routes, UI components).
    *   Your sole objective is to make the tests you just wrote pass.
    *   Commit the implementation code with a clear message, for example: `feat(wms): Implement supplier feature to pass tests`.

3.  **Phase C: Submit for Human Review**
    *   Create a single Pull Request containing all your commits (both tests and implementation).
    *   Inform the director that the PR is ready for their review. Your job is now to wait for feedback.

### For Feature Worktrees:
1.  **Propose Schema Change:** In your feature worktree, edit `./prisma/schema.prisma` and commit this change ONLY.
2.  **Propose Migration:** Run `npx prisma migrate dev --create-only` and commit the resulting migration folder ONLY.
3.  **Request Architectural Review:** Create a Pull Request to master containing these two commits.
4.  **HALT:** Stop all further work on the feature until the Pull Request has been approved and merged.
5.  **Continue After Approval:** Once merged, pull the changes into your feature worktree and continue development.

### For Master Worktree (PR Review):
1.  **Schema Impact Analysis:** Carefully review any schema changes for backward compatibility.
2.  **Migration Safety:** Ensure migrations won't cause data loss or break existing functionality.
3.  **Naming Conventions:** Verify all new models, fields follow project conventions.
4.  **Relationship Integrity:** Check that all foreign keys and relationships are properly defined.

## PART 3: ARCHITECTURAL & CODING STANDARDS (MANDATORY)

### 3.1. Core Technology Stack
Our **architecture is a unified, full-stack Next.js 14 application written in TypeScript**.
*   **Framework:** **Next.js 14 (App Router)**
*   **Language:** **TypeScript**.
*   **Database ORM:** **Prisma**.
*   **Authentication:** **NextAuth.js**.
*   **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS**.
*   **Linter & Formatter:** **ESLint** and **Prettier**.
*   **Dependency Management:** **npm** or **pnpm**.

### 3.2. UI Design & Component System
*   **Component Library:** You MUST use a headless, composable component library like **Shadcn/ui**.
*   **Icons:** Use **Lucide React**.
*   **Notifications:** Use **React Hot Toast**.
*   **Forms:** Use **React Hook Form**.

### 3.3. Git & Version Control Policy
*   **Branch Naming:** All branches MUST follow the format: `<feature_area>/<ticket_id>-<description>`. You will generate the ticket ID.
*   **PR Descriptions:** All PRs MUST clearly describe the feature being implemented.

### 3.4. Database Schema Governance
*   When a schema change is required, you must still present it clearly to the director for approval before proceeding with the rest of the implementation. For example: "I have determined a database change is needed. Here is the proposed Prisma schema modification. Do you approve?"

### 3.5. Development Server Port Assignment
*   **Port Assignment Rule:** When working on a new branch or feature, you MUST use an incrementally assigned port number for the development server.
*   **Base Port:** Start from port 3001 for the first feature branch.
*   **Increment:** Each new branch/feature gets the next port number (3002, 3003, etc.).
*   **Command:** Always run `npm run dev -- -p <PORT_NUMBER>` where PORT_NUMBER is the assigned port.
*   **Example:** For branch `wms-integration`, use port 3001: `npm run dev -- -p 3001`

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
