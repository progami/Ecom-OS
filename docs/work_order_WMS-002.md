# Work Order: WMS-002 - Warehouse Management System Integration

## Overview
Integrate the existing standalone warehouse_management application into the Ecom OS main project as a fully functional sub-application module.

## Objectives
1. Merge the warehouse_management codebase into the main Ecom OS project structure
2. Integrate database schemas while preserving all WMS business logic and constraints
3. Unify authentication systems between modules
4. Ensure consistent UI/UX across all Ecom OS modules
5. Preserve all existing WMS functionality including:
   - Multi-warehouse inventory tracking
   - Financial management (invoices, reconciliation)
   - Amazon FBA integration
   - Reporting and analytics
   - User management with role-based access

## Technical Requirements

### Database Integration
- Merge WMS Prisma schema into main project's schema.prisma
- Preserve all WMS tables, indexes, and constraints
- Maintain immutable ledger design with triggers
- Create proper migration files for the integration

### Authentication & Authorization
- Integrate WMS authentication with main project's NextAuth setup
- Preserve role-based access control (Admin/Staff)
- Ensure session sharing across all modules

### File Structure
- Move WMS pages to `/app/wms/` directory
- Move WMS API routes to `/app/api/v1/wms/`
- Move WMS components to `/components/wms/`
- Integrate WMS utilities and services into `/lib/`

### Dependencies
- Merge package.json dependencies
- Resolve any version conflicts
- Add missing WMS-specific dependencies to main project

### Environment Variables
- Consolidate environment variables
- Add WMS-specific variables to main .env structure
- Ensure proper configuration for all environments

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Specification & Testing (Current Phase)
1. **Analyze Integration Points**
   - Document all WMS dependencies and requirements
   - Identify potential conflicts with existing code
   - Create integration test plan

2. **Create Integration Tests**
   - Test database schema merging
   - Test authentication flow
   - Test API endpoint integration
   - Test UI component rendering

3. **Design Migration Strategy**
   - Plan file movement and refactoring
   - Design database migration approach
   - Create rollback plan

### Phase 2: Core Integration
1. **Database Integration**
   - Merge Prisma schemas
   - Create migration files
   - Test database integrity

2. **Authentication Integration**
   - Unify NextAuth configuration
   - Migrate user sessions
   - Test role-based access

3. **File Structure Migration**
   - Move WMS files to appropriate directories
   - Update import paths
   - Ensure build passes

### Phase 3: Feature Validation
1. **Module Testing**
   - Test all WMS operations (receive, ship, adjust)
   - Verify financial calculations
   - Test reporting functionality
   - Validate Amazon FBA integration

2. **Cross-Module Integration**
   - Ensure navigation between modules works
   - Test shared authentication
   - Verify consistent styling

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Load test integrated system
   - Optimize database queries
   - Ensure acceptable response times

### Phase 4: Deployment & Documentation
1. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Update deployment scripts
   - Configure production environment
   - Create backup procedures

2. **Documentation**
   - Update README files
   - Document new project structure
   - Create integration guide
   - Update API documentation

## Success Criteria
1. All existing WMS functionality works within the main Ecom OS project
2. Seamless navigation between WMS and other modules
3. Unified authentication across all modules
4. No degradation in performance
5. All tests pass (unit, integration, e2e)
6. Clean, maintainable code structure

## Risk Mitigation
1. **Data Loss Prevention**: Full database backups before migration
2. **Rollback Plan**: Git branches and database snapshots for quick rollback
3. **Gradual Migration**: Move components incrementally to catch issues early
4. **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite before going live

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 2-3 days
- Phase 2: 3-4 days
- Phase 3: 2-3 days
- Phase 4: 1-2 days

Total: 8-12 days

## Dependencies
- Access to production database for migration testing
- Environment configuration details
- Testing data sets
- Stakeholder availability for validation

## Notes
- The warehouse_management system is already production-ready with sophisticated features
- Special attention needed for preserving immutable ledger constraints
- Amazon FBA integration requires proper API credentials
- Weekly storage calculations and monthly billing cycles must be preserved
