#### 2. **API Routes Migration - Core Routes Complete**
Migrated to `/api/v1/wms/`:

- ✅ Transactions API (full CRUD + ledger + attributes + attachments)
- ✅ Finance APIs (cost-ledger, storage-ledger, calculated-costs, dashboard, reports)
- ✅ Settings APIs (notifications, security, rates management)
- ✅ SKU/Products APIs (full CRUD + batch numbering)
- ✅ Inventory APIs (balances, transactions)
- ✅ Warehouse APIs
- ✅ Amazon integration APIs (inventory comparison, sync)
- ✅ Dashboard stats API
- ✅ Reports API

#### 3. **Components Migration - 100% Complete**
All components migrated to `/components/wms/`:

- ✅ Layout components (dashboard-layout, main-nav)
- ✅ Operations components (inventory-tabs)
- ✅ Finance components (storage-ledger-tab)
- ✅ Shared components (empty-state, error-boundary, loading-spinner, page-header)
- ✅ UI components (immutable-ledger-notice)
- ✅ Warehouse components (warehouse-map)

#### 4. **Services & Utilities - 100% Complete**
Migrated to `/lib/wms/`:

- ✅ Calculation services (cost-aggregation, inventory-balance, storage-ledger)
- ✅ Configuration (shipment-planning)
- ✅ Hooks (useDebounce, useErrorHandler, useWarehouseAccess)
- ✅ Types (comprehensive type definitions)
- ✅ Utilities (auth-utils, financial-utils)

## Architecture Highlights

### 1. **Namespace Strategy**
All WMS models use the `Wms` prefix to avoid conflicts:
- `Warehouse` → `WmsWarehouse`
- `Product` → `WmsSku`
- `InventoryLog` → `WmsInventoryTransaction`

### 2. **Route Structure**
- Pages: `/wms/[module]/[page]`
- API: `/api/v1/wms/[resource]/[action]`
- Components: `/components/wms/[category]/[component]`

### 3. **Authentication Integration**
- Unified NextAuth configuration
- Support for both legacy admin and WMS users
- Role-based access control (admin/staff)
- Warehouse-specific permissions

## Features Preserved

All original WMS functionality has been maintained:

1. **Multi-warehouse Management**
   - Inventory tracking across locations
   - Warehouse-specific configurations
   - Location-based access control

2. **Financial Management**
   - Invoice creation and management
   - Automated reconciliation
   - Cost tracking and billing
   - Weekly storage calculations

3. **Operations**
   - Receive goods with document management
   - Ship goods with email notifications
   - Pallet variance tracking
   - Batch/lot management

4. **Amazon FBA Integration**
   - Inventory synchronization
   - Shipment planning
   - Stock level monitoring

5. **Reporting & Analytics**
   - Comprehensive dashboards
   - Financial reports
   - Inventory analytics
   - Export capabilities

## Technical Improvements

1. **Code Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns
