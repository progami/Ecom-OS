.github/workflows/
  └── deploy.yml          # GitHub Actions deployment workflow
deployment/
  ├── nginx.conf         # Nginx configuration for both sites
  ├── setup-server.sh    # Server setup script
  └── README.md          # Deployment documentation

```

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. **GitHub Repository Setup**
- Push this code to your GitHub repository
- Update the repository URL in `/deployment/setup-server.sh`
- Add the following secrets to GitHub (Settings → Secrets → Actions):
  - `EC2_SSH_KEY`: Your server's SSH private key
  - `EC2_HOST`: Your server's IP address
  - `EC2_USER`: SSH username (e.g., ubuntu)
  - `PRODUCTION_URL`: https://www.targonglobal.com

### 2. **Server Preparation**
- Ensure your EC2 instance has:
  - Node.js 18.x or higher
  - npm installed
  - nginx installed
  - Git installed
  - Port 3000 available (main site will run here)
  - Port 3001 for WMS (should already be running)

### 3. **Initial Server Setup**
SSH into your server and run:
```bash
# Clone your repository
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
cd YOUR_REPO/deployment

# Run setup script
chmod +x setup-server.sh
./setup-server.sh
```

### 4. **SSL Certificate Setup**
After the initial setup, configure SSL:
```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d targonglobal.com -d www.targonglobal.com
```

### 5. **Verify Deployment**
- Main site: https://www.targonglobal.com
- WMS portal: https://www.targonglobal.com/WMS

## Important Configuration Notes

### Nginx Routing
- `/` → Port 3000 (Targon Global frontend)
- `/WMS` → Port 3001 (Existing WMS application)

### Process Management
- Main site managed by PM2 as "targon-frontend"
- WMS should continue running as configured

### Deployment Workflow
1. Push to main branch triggers GitHub Actions
2. Workflow builds the application
3. Deploys to server via SSH
4. Restarts PM2 process
5. Performs health check

## Testing Locally

To test the application locally:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

To test production build:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## Monitoring

Once deployed, monitor the application:
```bash
# Check PM2 status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs targon-frontend

# Check nginx logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/targonglobal.access.log
```

## Security Reminders

1. Keep all dependencies updated
2. Ensure firewall allows only necessary ports (80, 443)
3. Regular security updates on the server
4. Monitor for any suspicious activity

## Support

For any issues during deployment:
1. Check the deployment logs in GitHub Actions
2. Review PM2 logs on the server
3. Verify nginx configuration
4. Ensure all required ports are available

The frontend is now ready for deployment to production!
